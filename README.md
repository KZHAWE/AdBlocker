# AdBlocker
Welcome to my adblocker! Here is information on how to use this and how to customize it. 
First and foremost, this will not block all ads. It is made to be simple, and thus is more like a template. To block requests from specific services, simply add the URLs you want to block in background.js.

How to install:
To install, go to the main page, click on the green "code" button, and press "download ZIP".
Then, go to your extensions page. This will be something like chrome://extensions or edge://extensions, depending on your browser.
Turn on developer mode.
Click on "load unpacked"
Upload the ENTIRE folder. 
And you're good to go! Again, if you want to block ads from specific services, simply add those in the background.js file.
